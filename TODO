1. Implement proper cylinder visualization instead of capsule for bevy_rapier3d when we switch to bevy 0.7 from 0.6
(waiting because i dont want to maintain a version of bevy 0.6 locally)
2. give camera a dynamic collision that corrects camera's position when bumping
3. following camera (almost done)
4. steering
5. more terrain for test: angles, bumps
6. friction tests
7. center of mass tests
8. damping/stiffness tests
9. add salva?
10. try models?
11. bug: wheels collision doesnt correspond to visual!
12. suspension
