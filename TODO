1. Implement proper cylinder visualization instead of capsule for bevy_rapier3d when we switch to bevy 0.7 from 0.6
(waiting because i dont want to maintain a version of bevy 0.6 locally)
2. give camera a dynamic collision that corrects camera's position when bumping
3. (done!) following camera
4. (done!)steering: try using two joints with two body instead of just one wheel
4.1. (done!)stabilize steering
5. more terrain for test: angles, bumps
6. friction tests
7. center of mass tests
8. (done!)damping/stiffness tests
9. add salva?
10. try models?
11. bug: wheels collision doesnt correspond to visual!
12. suspension
13. (wip)ui for different parameters tweaking (see rapier all_examples3)
14. research how to release cursor when hitting breakpoint
15. (done!)bug: joints with wheels fall asleep too fast and we cant wake them up with motor
