1. Implement proper cylinder visualization instead of capsule for bevy_rapier3d when new version of bevy_rapier3d drops
2. give camera a dynamic collision that corrects camera's position when bumping
3. (done!) following camera
4. (done!)steering: try using two joints with two body instead of just one wheel
4.1. (done!)stabilize steering
5. more terrain for test: angles, bumps
6. friction tests
7. center of mass tests
8. (done!)damping/stiffness tests
9. add salva?
10. try models?
11. bug: wheels collision doesnt correspond to visual!
12. suspension
13. (wip)ui for different parameters tweaking (see rapier all_examples3)
13.1. (done!)figure out how to change ColliderMassProps::Density
13.2. (wip always use Mut< for components from Query)figure out what's wrong with body section and why camera starts pointing to a different object
13.3. make wheel position adjustable
13.4. make wheel position attached to body size
13.5. make motor adjustable
13.6. make axles adjustable
13.7. make center of mass adjustable
13.8. (wip)make mass adjustable
13.9. add a tab where all parameters of entities with same type are adjustable with one control 
14. research how to release cursor when hitting breakpoint
15. (done!)bug: joints with wheels fall asleep too fast and we cant wake them up with motor
16. (done!)update bevy to 0.7
17. make a collection of presets of vehicles after 13 is done
18. (wait until 0.7?)return changes to upstream: bevy_fly_camera
19. return changes to upstream: rapier
20. (done!)remove duplication 4 times of all code for wheels, axles etc

next milestone: fully configurable vehicle with an environment to test it
