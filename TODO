1. (done!)Implement proper cylinder visualization instead of capsule for bevy_rapier3d when new version of bevy_rapier3d drops
2. give camera a dynamic collision that corrects camera's position when bumping
3. (done!) following camera
4. (done!)steering: try using two joints with two body instead of just one wheel
4.1. (done!)stabilize steering
5. more terrain for test: angles, bumps
6. friction tests
7. center of mass tests
8. (done!)damping/stiffness tests
9. add salva?
10. try models?
11. (done!)bug: wheels collision doesnt correspond to visual!
12. suspension
13. (wip)ui for different parameters tweaking (see rapier all_examples3)
13.1. (done!)figure out how to change ColliderMassProps::Density
13.2. (done! always use Mut< for components from Query)figure out what's wrong with body section and why camera starts pointing to a different object
13.3. (done!)make wheel position adjustable
13.4. (done!)make wheel position attached to body size
13.5. (done!)make motor adjustable
13.6. (done!)make axles adjustable
13.7. make center of mass adjustable
13.8. (done!)make mass adjustable
13.9. add a tab where all parameters of entities with same type are adjustable with one control 
13.10. auto adjust masses on wheels/axles when changing body?
13.11. (done!)auto adjust offset on wheels/axles when changing body/axles
13.12. show total mass
13.13. make friction adjustable
14. research how to release cursor when hitting breakpoint
15. (done!)bug: joints with wheels fall asleep too fast and we cant wake them up with motor
16. (done!)update bevy to 0.7
17. make a collection of presets of vehicles after 13 is done
18. (wait until it gets updated to 0.7 first?)return changes to upstream: bevy_fly_camera
19. (done)return changes to upstream: rapier
20. (done!)remove duplication 4 times of all code for wheels, axles etc
21. (done!)update bevy_rapier to 0.13
22. implement neutral mode for driving (for now we always stop without input)
23. bridge of leonardo
24. (fixed!)bug: when typing data into egui we get a conflict of hiding/showing mouse cursor because app also does this independently
25. (done!)get a working vehicle again
26. (done!)respawn button
27. (done!)make kinematic(fixed) button
28. (?)adjustable ranges for density, sizes etc
29. trailer
30. (done!)serialize configs and save/load
31. more wheels
32. two wheels
33. complex wheel shape
34. turn off vehicle controls when using gui
35. show gui dialog instead of println error messages

next milestone: fully configurable vehicle with an environment to test it
